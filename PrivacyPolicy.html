  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">App: Price Calc &nbsp;·&nbsp; Developer: no10messi.skr &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Price Calc is a unit price calculator app. The core calculation features work entirely on-device with no internet connection required. However, the optional live rate features (exchange rates and SOL price) make read-only outbound requests to third-party data providers as described below.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>Price Calc does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information. No account or login is required. No usage analytics or advertising identifiers are gathered.</p>

  <h2>Internet Access &amp; Outbound Requests</h2>
  <p>When live rate display is active, the app makes anonymous, read-only HTTP requests to the following external services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pyth Network (Hermes REST API)</strong> — <a href="https://hermes.pyth.network">hermes.pyth.network</a><br>
        Used to retrieve the current SOL/USD price feed. Requests contain only the requested price feed identifier; no personal data is transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Frankfurter API</strong> — <a href="https://www.frankfurter.app">frankfurter.app</a><br>
        Used to retrieve live fiat currency exchange rates (USD base). Requests contain no personal data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both services are queried at most once every 60 seconds. No data entered by the user is ever sent to these or any other servers.</p>

  <h2>Blockchain &amp; Wallet</h2>
  <p>Price Calc does not connect to any blockchain network for transactions and does not interact with cryptocurrency wallets. The Pyth Network integration is strictly a read-only price oracle query — no on-chain transactions are initiated and no wallet credentials are accessed.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The two data providers listed above operate under their own privacy policies. Price Calc is not responsible for the data practices of Pyth Network or Frankfurter. Their services are queried anonymously and solely to display indicative rate information within the app.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy is ever updated, the new version will be posted at this URL with a revised date.</p>
