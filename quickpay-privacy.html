  <div class="highlight">
    QuickPay is a non-custodial, serverless Solana payment app. We do not operate any servers, and we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
  </div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>QuickPay allows users to send and receive SOL, USDC, and USDT on the Solana blockchain using fixed-amount QR codes. All transactions occur directly on the Solana network. QuickPay never holds, controls, or has access to user funds or private keys.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>QuickPay collects no personal information. We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other identifying information. No account or registration is required.</p>

  <h2>Private Keys &amp; Wallet Security</h2>
  <p>QuickPay does not access your private keys or seed phrase. All cryptographic signing is handled exclusively by the Solana Mobile Seed Vault, a secure hardware element on your device. QuickPay never sees, stores, or transmits your private key.</p>

  <h2>Blockchain Transactions</h2>
  <p>When you send or receive a payment, the transaction is broadcast directly to the Solana blockchain. Blockchain transactions are public by nature. QuickPay does not store transaction records on any server — all history is available on the public Solana ledger.</p>

  <h2>No Servers</h2>
  <p>QuickPay operates without a backend server. The app communicates directly with Solana RPC nodes solely to submit and confirm transactions. We do not log, store, or analyze any of this activity.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>QuickPay does not integrate any advertising, analytics, or tracking services. The app communicates directly with Solana RPC nodes (including public endpoints and Helius, a third-party RPC provider) solely to query and submit transactions on the Solana blockchain. No personal data is transmitted to these services.</p>
  <p>QuickPay uses the CoinGecko API solely to fetch real-time SOL/USD price data for display purposes. No personal data is sent to CoinGecko. The USD amounts shown in the app are reference values only — actual transactions settle in SOL on the Solana blockchain.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>QuickPay does not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy is updated, the new version will be published at this URL with a revised date.</p>
