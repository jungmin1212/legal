  <div class="highlight">
    QuickPay is a non-custodial, serverless Solana payment app. We do not operate any servers, and we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
  </div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>QuickPay allows users to send and receive SOL, USDC, and USDT on the Solana blockchain using fixed-amount QR codes. All transactions occur directly on the Solana network. QuickPay never holds, controls, or has access to user funds or private keys.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>QuickPay collects no personal information. We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other identifying information. No account or registration is required.</p>

  <h2>Private Keys &amp; Wallet Security</h2>
  <p>QuickPay does not access your private keys or seed phrase. All cryptographic signing is handled exclusively by the Solana Mobile Seed Vault, a secure hardware element on your device. QuickPay never sees, stores, or transmits your private key.</p>

  <h2>Blockchain Transactions</h2>
  <p>When you send or receive a payment, the transaction is broadcast directly to the Solana blockchain. Blockchain transactions are public by nature. QuickPay does not store transaction records on any server — all history is available on the public Solana ledger.</p>

  <h2>No Servers</h2>
  <p>QuickPay operates without a backend server. The app communicates directly with Solana RPC nodes solely to submit and confirm transactions. We do not log, store, or analyze any of this activity.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>QuickPay does not integrate any advertising, analytics, or tracking services. The app communicates directly with Solana RPC nodes (including public endpoints and Helius, a third-party RPC provider) solely to query and submit transactions on the Solana blockchain. No personal data is transmitted to these services.</p>
  <p>When SOL is selected, QuickPay fetches real-time SOL/USD price data for display purposes using the following services in order of priority:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Jupiter Price API (<code>api.jup.ag</code>) — used first for all price lookups.</li>
    <li><strong>Fallback:</strong> CoinGecko API — used only when the Jupiter API is unavailable or returns no data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No personal data is transmitted to either service. The USD amounts and token quantity estimates shown in the app are approximate reference values derived from market price data and may differ from actual on-chain amounts. The app displays an "≈" symbol to indicate that values are estimates. Users are responsible for verifying the exact token amount before confirming any transaction.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>QuickPay does not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy is updated, the new version will be published at this URL with a revised date.</p>
